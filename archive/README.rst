andor neo spool readers
=======================

These are kept for legacy info only (for example, experiment parameters). 
Don't use them normally, I don't hold by these processsing techniques

instead use ../NeoPacked12bitConvert.m to put the spool data into FITS or HDF5 and use your own processing techniques.
