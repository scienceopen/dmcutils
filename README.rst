dmcutils
=========

Programs used to help with the Dual-Multi-sCale (DMC) experiment.
Example of dealing with 100000 - 1 million Andor Neo spool files in a fast way (using GNU Octave or Matlab)

Note:
=====
This is very messy, we will update this code when we actually use it again. I put the most recent version here so we would know where to pickup from.

Experiments:
------------

**2013 Jan 13** great example, run in Octave 4.0+ or Matlab 
``RunSimulPlayFor2013Jan13`` to show simultaneous video from cameras

-datadir       path to data files
-writevid      filename to write to (uncompressed AVI)
