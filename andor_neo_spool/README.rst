andor neo spool readers

Utilities for reading 2008-Spring 2011 beta Andor Solis .dat spool files. In particular, this spool file type was used by the Bob Marshall / Hanna Dahlgren / Genny Plant experiment team for the Mishap experiment in Ester, AK and Poker Flat Research Range, AK.

These files do not work for Fall 2011 or newer Andor Solis spool files, the spool file
format has changed multiple times. 

Feel free to contact me for help if you have some spool files to read.
